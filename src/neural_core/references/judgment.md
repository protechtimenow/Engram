# Judgment Domain Reference

## Core Principles

1. **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge what you don't know
2. **Probabilistic Thinking**: Express confidence as probabilities
3. **Updating**: Revise beliefs with new evidence
4. **Diversity of Thought**: Seek multiple perspectives

## Reasoning Quality

### Logical Structure
- **Premises**: Are the starting points valid?
- **Inference**: Does conclusion follow from premises?
- **Soundness**: Valid + true premises = sound argument
- **Completeness**: Are there missing considerations?

### Common Fallacies
```
Formal Fallacies:
- Affirming the consequent
- Denying the antecedent
- Undistributed middle

Informal Fallacies:
- Ad hominem (attack person, not argument)
- Straw man (misrepresent opponent)
- False dichotomy (only two options)
- Slippery slope (inevitable cascade)
- Appeal to authority (expert ≠ correct)
- Circular reasoning (conclusion as premise)
```

### Cognitive Biases
```
Judgment & Decision Making:
- Confirmation bias
- Availability heuristic
- Anchoring and adjustment
- Overconfidence effect
- Hindsight bias
- Sunk cost fallacy
- Framing effects

Social Biases:
- Groupthink
- In-group favoritism
- Status quo bias
- Authority bias
```

## Confidence Calibration

### Good Calibration
- 90% confidence: Right 90% of the time
- Track predictions to improve
- Separate confidence from evidence strength

### Overconfidence Signs
- Excessive certainty ("definitely", "impossible")
- Narrow confidence intervals
- Failure to consider alternatives
- Dismissing contradictory evidence

## Structured Analysis

### Devil's Advocate
1. State the conclusion
2. List strongest arguments for it
3. Now argue the opposite
4. Synthesize balanced view

### Pre-Mortem
1. Assume the decision failed
2. Explain why (before it happens)
3. Identify warning signs
4. Create contingency plans

### Red Teaming
1. Assemble critics
2. Attack the proposal
3. Surface weaknesses
4. Strengthen or abandon

## Output Format

```
CLAIM: (statement being evaluated)
REASONING_QUALITY: (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
LOGICAL_VALIDITY: (Valid/Invalid)
PREMISE_TRUTH: (All true/Some true/Unknown)
SOUNDNESS: (Sound/Unsound/Unclear)
CONFIDENCE: (0-100% with calibration note)
BIASES_CHECKED: (confirmation, anchoring, etc.)
FALLACIES_FOUND: (list or "None")
ALTERNATIVES: (other reasonable positions)
QUALIFYING_CONDITIONS: (when claim holds/fails)
```

## Judgment Heuristics

1. **Outside View**: How often does this happen generally?
2. **Reference Class**: What category does this belong to?
3. **Base Rates**: Start with population statistics
4. **Fermi Estimation**: Break into estimable components
5. **Devil's Advocate**: Always consider the opposite

## Improving Judgment

- **Keep Decision Journal**: Track predictions and outcomes
- **Seek Disconfirmation**: Actively look for contrary evidence
- **Delay Intuition**: First impression may be wrong
- **Consider Base Rates**: Don't ignore prior probabilities
- **Diversify Inputs**: Multiple perspectives reduce blind spots
- **Calibrate Confidence**: Regular prediction tracking

## Questions for Better Judgment

1. What would prove me wrong?
2. What's the base rate for this type of event?
3. Have I sought disconfirming evidence?
4. Am I confusing confidence with accuracy?
5. What are the second-order effects?
6. How would someone smart disagree?
7. What's the opportunity cost?
