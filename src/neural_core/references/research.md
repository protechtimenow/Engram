# Research Domain Reference

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence Hierarchy**: Data > Anecdote > Opinion
2. **Source Quality**: Primary > Secondary > Tertiary
3. **Bias Awareness**: All sources have perspective
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals over point estimates

## Analysis Framework

### Claim Verification
- **Source Check**: Who made the claim? What's their expertise?
- **Evidence Review**: What supports the claim?
- **Counter-Evidence**: What contradicts it?
- **Confidence Score**: 0-100% with rationale

### Pattern Detection
- **Logical Fallacies**: Ad hominem, straw man, appeal to authority
- **Cognitive Biases**: Confirmation, anchoring, availability
- **Statistical Errors**: Correlation≠causation, small samples
- **Rhetorical Devices**: Loaded language, false dichotomies

### Bias Detection Checklist
```
Confirmation Bias:
- Only seeking supporting evidence?
- Ignoring contradictory data?
- Selective interpretation?

Anchoring Bias:
- Fixated on initial information?
- Insufficient adjustment from starting point?
- Overvaluing "first impression"?

Recency Bias:
- Overweighting recent events?
- Ignoring historical context?
- Assuming trends continue?

Availability Heuristic:
- Judging by ease of recall?
- Media coverage ≠ importance?
- Personal exposure bias?
```

## Output Format

```
CLAIM: (exact claim being evaluated)
VERDICT: (SUPPORTED/PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED/UNSUPPORTED/UNVERIFIABLE)
CONFIDENCE: (0-100% with range)
EVIDENCE_STRENGTH: (0-1 scale)
BIASES_DETECTED: (list with severity)
KEY_ASSUMPTIONS: (what must be true)
MISSING_INFO: (gaps in knowledge)
RECOMMENDATION: (how to use this info)
```

## Quality Indicators

Strong Evidence:
- Peer-reviewed studies
- Primary data sources
- Transparent methodology
- Replicable results
- Conflicts of interest disclosed

Weak Evidence:
- Anecdotal reports
- Unverified sources
- Methodology unclear
- Cherry-picked data
- Financial conflicts hidden

## Research Heuristics

1. **Falsifiability**: Can the claim be proven wrong?
2. **Occam's Razor**: Simplest explanation is usually best
3. **Extraordinary Claims**: Require extraordinary evidence
4. **Correlation**: Doesn't imply causation
5. **Sample Size**: Larger is better, check representativeness
